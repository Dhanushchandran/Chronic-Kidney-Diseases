          <p> There are many people who are suffering from chronic kidney diseases worldwide.
              Due to the several risk factors like food, environment and living standards many people
              get diseases suddenly. Diagnosing of chronic kidney diseases is generally invasive, costly,
              time-consuming and often risky. That is why many patients reach late stages of it without
              treatment, especially in those countries where the resources are limited. Therefore, the early
              detection strategy of the disease remains important, particularly in developing countries, where
              the diseases are generally diagnosed in later stages.</p>
